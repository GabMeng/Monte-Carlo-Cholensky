This repository contains a Python script that implements Cholesky decomposition to generate correlated random variables and performs Monte Carlo simulations using the decomposed data. The script is designed to be a useful tool for generating correlated samples for various statistical analyses and simulations. It consists in a first theoretical part where the calculation for the Cholensky decomp are provided in basic python, and then the method is applied to a time series of 4 stocks from the ISE.
